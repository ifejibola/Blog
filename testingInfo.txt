Types OF TESTING :

# Unit Testing (single components):
    very fine-grained testing single components to make sure they function properly.

# Integration Testing (Btw Mulitple components):
    tests the interaction between Mulitple components or even whole system.


QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) TECHNIQUES :

Page Testing :
    "Page testing" : tests the presentation and frontend functionality of a page.
                    This can involve both unit and integration testing.(using Mocha)

    "Cross-page-testing" :  Involves testing functionality that requires NAVIGATION from 
                    one page to another. e.g ecommerce site CHECKOUT page spans multiple pages.
                    Since it involves more than one component, it is considered integration testing.
                    (using Zombie.js)

    "Logic Testing" :   Will execute unit and integration tests against our logic domain.
                        It will be testing only javaScript.

    "Linting"   :   It isn't about finding errors, but potential errors. The general concept
                    of linting is that it identifies areas that could represent possible errors, 
                    or fragile constructs that could lead to errors in the future.
                    (using JSHint)

    "Link checking" : make sure there are no broken links on your site.

#
Tests usually require a function called assert (or expect). 
This is available in the Node framework, but not inherently in a browser,
 so weâ€™ll be using the Chai assertion library:
